NOTE: Kudu is easier to manage with link:http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/products/cloudera-manager.html[Cloudera Manager]
than in a standalone installation. See Cloudera's
link:http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/kudu/latest/topics/kudu_installation.html[Kudu documentation]
for more details about using Kudu with Cloudera Manager.

== Starting and Stopping Kudu Processes

NOTE: These instructions are relevant only when Kudu is installed using operating system packages
(e.g. `rpm` or `deb`).

include::installation.adoc[tags=start_stop]

== Kudu Web Interfaces

Kudu tablet servers and masters expose useful operational information on a built-in web interface,

=== Kudu Master Web Interface

Kudu master processes serve their web interface on port 8051. The interface exposes several pages
with information about the cluster state:

- A list of tablet servers, their host names, and the time of their last heartbeat.
- A list of tables, including schema and tablet location information for each.
- SQL code which you can paste into Impala Shell to add an existing table to Impala's list of known data sources.

=== Kudu Tablet Server Web Interface

Each tablet server serves a web interface on port 8050. The interface exposes information
about each tablet hosted on the server, its current state, and debugging information
about maintenance background operations.

=== Common Web Interface Pages

Both Kudu masters and tablet servers expose a common set of information via their web interfaces:

- HTTP access to server logs.
- an `/rpcz` endpoint which lists currently running RPCs via JSON.
- pages giving an overview and detailed information on the memory usage of different
  components of the process.
- information on the current set of configuration flags.
- information on the currently running threads and their resource consumption.
- a JSON endpoint exposing metrics about the server.
- information on the deployed version number of the daemon.

These interfaces are linked from the landing page of each daemon's web UI.

== Kudu Metrics

Kudu daemons expose a large number of metrics. Some metrics are associated with an entire
server process, whereas others are associated with a particular tablet replica.

=== Listing available metrics

The full set of available metrics for a Kudu server can be dumped via a special command
line flag:

[source,bash]
----
$ kudu-tserver --dump_metrics_json
$ kudu-master --dump_metrics_json
----

This will output a large JSON document. Each metric indicates its name, label, description,
units, and type. Because the output is JSON-formatted, this information can easily be
parsed and fed into other tooling which collects metrics from Kudu servers.

=== Collecting metrics via HTTP

Metrics can be collected from a server process via its HTTP interface by visiting
`/metrics`. The output of this page is JSON for easy parsing by monitoring services.
This endpoint accepts several `GET` parameters in its query string:

- `/metrics?metrics=<substring1>,<substring2>,...` - limits the returned metrics to those which contain
at least one of the provided substrings. The substrings also match entity names, so this
may be used to collect metrics for a specific tablet.

- `/metrics?include_schema=1` - includes metrics schema information such as unit, description,
and label in the JSON output. This information is typically elided to save space.

- `/metrics?compact=1` - eliminates unnecessary whitespace from the resulting JSON, which can decrease
bandwidth when fetching this page from a remote host.

- `/metrics?include_raw_histograms=1` - include the raw buckets and values for histogram metrics,
enabling accurate aggregation of percentile metrics over time and across hosts.

For example:

[source,bash]

$ curl -s 'http://example-ts:8050/metrics?include_schema=1&metrics=connections_accepted'

            }
        ]
    }
]
----

NOTE: All histograms and counters are measured since the server start time, and are not reset upon collection.

=== Diagnostics Logging

Kudu may be configured to dump various diagnostics information to a local log file.
The diagnostics log will be written to the same directory as the other Kudu log files, with a
similar naming format, substituting `diagnostics` instead of a log level like `INFO`.
After any diagnostics log file reaches 64MB uncompressed, the log will be rolled and
the previous file will be gzip-compressed.

Each line in the diagnostics log consists of the following components:

* A human-readable timestamp formatted in the same fashion as the other Kudu log files.
* The type of record. For example, a metrics record consists of the word `metrics`.
* A machine-readable timestamp, in microseconds since the Unix epoch.
* The record itself.

Currently, the only type of diagnostics record is a periodic dump of the server metrics.
Each record is encoded in compact JSON format, and the server attempts to elide any metrics
which have not changed since the previous record. In addition, counters which have never
been incremented are elided. Otherwise, the format of the JSON record is identical to the
format exposed by the HTTP endpoint above.

The frequency with which metrics are dumped to the diagnostics log is configured using the
`--metrics_log_interval_ms` flag. By default, Kudu logs metrics every 60 seconds.

== Common Kudu workflows

[[migrate_to_multi_master]]
=== Migrating to Multiple Kudu Masters

For high availability and to avoid a single point of failure, Kudu clusters should be created with
multiple masters. Many Kudu clusters were created with just a single master, either for simplicity
or because Kudu multi-master support was still experimental at the time. This workflow demonstrates
how to migrate to a multi-master configuration. It can also be used to migrate from two masters to
three, with straightforward modifications.

WARNING: The workflow is unsafe for adding new masters to an existing configuration that already has
three or more masters. Do not use it for that purpose.

WARNING: All of the command line steps below should be executed as the Kudu UNIX user. The example
commands assume the Kudu Unix user is `kudu`, which is typical.

WARNING: The workflow presupposes at least basic familiarity with Kudu configuration management. If
using Cloudera Manager (CM), the workflow also presupposes familiarity with it.

==== Prepare for the migration

. Establish a maintenance window (one hour should be sufficient). During this time the Kudu cluster
  will be unavailable.

. Decide how many masters to use. The number of masters should be odd. Three or five node master
  configurations are recommended; they can tolerate one or two failures respectively.

. Perform the following preparatory steps for the existing master:
* Identify and record the directories where the master's write-ahead log (WAL) and data live. If
  using Kudu system packages, their default locations are /var/lib/kudu/master, but they may be
  customized via the `fs_wal_dir` and `fs_data_dirs` configuration parameters. The commands below
  assume that `fs_wal_dir` is /data/kudu/master/wal and `fs_data_dirs` is /data/kudu/master/data.
  Your configuration may differ. For more information on configuring these directories, see the
  link:configuration.html#directory_configuration[Kudu Configuration docs].
* Identify and record the port the master is using for RPCs. The default port value is 7051, but it
  may have been customized using the `rpc_bind_addresses` configuration parameter.
* Identify the master's UUID. It can be fetched using the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs dump uuid --fs_wal_dir=<master_wal_dir> [--fs_data_dirs=<master_data_dirs>] 2>/dev/null
----
master_data_dir:: existing master's previously recorded data directory
+
[source,bash]
Example::
+
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs dump uuid --fs_wal_dir=/data/kudu/master/wal --fs_data_dirs=/data/kudu/master/data 2>/dev/null
4aab798a69e94fab8d77069edff28ce0
----
+
* Optional: configure a DNS alias for the master. The alias could be a DNS cname (if the machine
  already has an A record in DNS), an A record (if the machine is only known by its IP address),
  or an alias in /etc/hosts. The alias should be an abstract representation of the master (e.g.
  `master-1`).
+
WARNING: Without DNS aliases it is not possible to recover from permanent master failures without
bringing the cluster down for maintenance, and as such, it is highly recommended.
+
. If you have Kudu tables that are accessed from Impala, you must update
the master addresses in the Apache Hive Metastore (HMS) database.
* If you set up the DNS aliases, run the following statement in `impala-shell`,
replacing `master-1`, `master-2`, and `master-3` with your actual aliases.
+
[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE table_name
SET TBLPROPERTIES
('kudu.master_addresses' = 'master-1,master-2,master-3');
----
+
* If you do not have DNS aliases set up, see Step #11 in the Performing
the migration section for updating HMS.
+
. Perform the following preparatory steps for each new master:
* Choose an unused machine in the cluster. The master generates very little load so it can be
  colocated with other data services or load-generating processes, though not with another Kudu
  master from the same configuration.
* Ensure Kudu is installed on the machine, either via system packages (in which case the `kudu` and
  `kudu-master` packages should be installed), or via some other means.
* Choose and record the directory where the master's data will live.
* Choose and record the port the master should use for RPCs.
* Optional: configure a DNS alias for the master (e.g. `master-2`, `master-3`, etc).

[[perform-the-migration]]
==== Perform the migration

. Stop all the Kudu processes in the entire cluster.

. Format the data directory on each new master machine, and record the generated UUID. Use the
  following command sequence:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs format --fs_wal_dir=<master_wal_dir> [--fs_data_dirs=<master_data_dirs>]

+
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs format --fs_wal_dir=/data/kudu/master/wal --fs_data_dirs=/data/kudu/master/data
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs dump uuid --fs_wal_dir=/data/kudu/master/wal --fs_data_dirs=/data/kudu/master/data 2>/dev/null
f5624e05f40649b79a757629a69d061e
----

. If using CM, add the new Kudu master roles now, but do not start them.
* If using DNS aliases, override the empty value of the `Master Address` parameter for each role
  (including the existing master role) with that master's alias.
* Add the port number (separated by a colon) if using a non-default RPC port value.

. Rewrite the master's Raft configuration with the following command, executed on the existing
  master machine:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu local_replica cmeta rewrite_raft_config --fs_wal_dir=<master_wal_dir> [--fs_data_dirs=<master_data_dirs>] <tablet_id> <all_masters>
----
+
master_data_dir:: existing master's previously recorded data directory
tablet_id:: must be the string `00000000000000000000000000000000`
all_masters:: space-separated list of masters, both new and existing. Each entry in the list must be
  a string of the form `<uuid>:<hostname>:<port>`

----

. Modify the value of the `master_addresses` configuration parameter for both existing master and new masters.
  The new value must be a comma-separated list of all of the masters. Each entry is a string of the form `<hostname>:<port>`
hostname:: master's previously recorded hostname or alias
port:: master's previously recorded RPC port number

. Start the existing master.

. Copy the master data to each new master with the following command, executed on each new master
  machine.
+
WARNING: If your Kudu cluster is secure, in addition to running as the Kudu UNIX user, you must
  authenticate as the Kudu service user prior to running this command.
+
[source,bash]

----

. Start all of the new masters.
+
WARNING: Skip the next step if using CM.

. If you have Kudu tables that are accessed from Impala and you didn't set up
DNS aliases, update the HMS database manually in the underlying database that
provides the storage for HMS.
* The following is an example SQL statement you should run in the HMS database:
+
[source,sql]
----
UPDATE TABLE_PARAMS
SET PARAM_VALUE =
  'master-1.example.com,master-2.example.com,master-3.example.com'
WHERE PARAM_KEY = 'kudu.master_addresses' AND PARAM_VALUE = 'old-master';
----
+
* In `impala-shell`, run:
+
[source,bash]
----
INVALIDATE METADATA;
----
+

==== Verify the migration was successful

To verify that all masters are working properly, perform the following sanity checks:

* Using a browser, visit each master's web UI. Look at the /masters page. All of the masters should
  be listed there with one master in the LEADER role and the others in the FOLLOWER role. The
  contents of /masters on each master should be the same.

* Run a Kudu system check (ksck) on the cluster using the `kudu` command line
  tool. See <<ksck>> for more details.

=== Recovering from a dead Kudu Master in a Multi-Master Deployment

Kudu multi-master deployments function normally in the event of a master loss. However, it is
important to replace the dead master; otherwise a second failure may lead to a loss of availability,
depending on the number of available masters. This workflow describes how to replace the dead
master.

Due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1620[KUDU-1620], it is not possible to perform
this workflow without also restarting the live masters. As such, the workflow requires a
maintenance window, albeit a potentially brief one if the cluster was set up with DNS aliases.

WARNING: Kudu does not yet support live Raft configuration changes for masters. As such, it is only
possible to replace a master if the deployment was created with DNS aliases or if every node in the
cluster is first shut down. See the <<migrate_to_multi_master,multi-master migration workflow>> for
more details on deploying with DNS aliases.

WARNING: The workflow presupposes at least basic familiarity with Kudu configuration management. If
using Cloudera Manager (CM), the workflow also presupposes familiarity with it.

WARNING: All of the command line steps below should be executed as the Kudu UNIX user, typically
`kudu`.

==== Prepare for the recovery

. If the deployment was configured without DNS aliases perform the following steps:
* Establish a maintenance window (one hour should be sufficient). During this time the Kudu cluster
  will be unavailable.
* Shut down all Kudu tablet server processes in the cluster.

. Ensure that the dead master is well and truly dead. Take whatever steps needed to prevent it from
  accidentally restarting; this can be quite dangerous for the cluster post-recovery.

. Choose one of the remaining live masters to serve as a basis for recovery. The rest of this
  workflow will refer to this master as the "reference" master.

. Choose an unused machine in the cluster where the new master will live. The master generates very
  little load so it can be colocated with other data services or load-generating processes, though
  not with another Kudu master from the same configuration. The rest of this workflow will refer to
  this master as the "replacement" master.

. Perform the following preparatory steps for the replacement master:
* Ensure Kudu is installed on the machine, either via system packages (in which case the `kudu` and
  `kudu-master` packages should be installed), or via some other means.
* Choose and record the directory where the master's data will live.

. Perform the following preparatory steps for each live master:
* Identify and record the directory where the master's data lives. If using Kudu system packages,
  the default value is /var/lib/kudu/master, but it may be customized via the `fs_wal_dir` and
  `fs_data_dirs` configuration parameters. Please note if you've set `fs_data_dirs` to some directories
  other than the value of `fs_wal_dir`, it should be explicitly included in every command below where
  `fs_wal_dir` is also included. For more information on configuring these directories, see the
  link:configuration.html#directory_configuration[Kudu Configuration docs].
* Identify and record the master's UUID. It can be fetched using the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs dump uuid --fs_wal_dir=<master_wal_dir> [--fs_data_dirs=<master_data_dirs>] 2>/dev/null
----
master_data_dir:: live master's previously recorded data directory
+
[source,bash]
Example::

----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs dump uuid --fs_wal_dir=/data/kudu/master/wal --fs_data_dirs=/data/kudu/master/data 2>/dev/null
80a82c4b8a9f4c819bab744927ad765c
----
+
. Perform the following preparatory steps for the reference master:
* Identify and record the directory where the master's data lives. If using Kudu system packages,
  the default value is /var/lib/kudu/master, but it may be customized via the `fs_wal_dir` and
  `fs_data_dirs` configuration parameters. Please note if you've set `fs_data_dirs` to some directories
  other than the value of `fs_wal_dir`, it should be explicitly included in every command below where
  `fs_wal_dir` is also included. For more information on configuring these directories, see the
  link:configuration.html#directory_configuration[Kudu Configuration docs].
* Identify and record the UUIDs of every master in the cluster, using the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu local_replica cmeta print_replica_uuids --fs_wal_dir=<master_wal_dir> [--fs_data_dirs=<master_data_dirs>] <tablet_id> 2>/dev/null
----
master_data_dir:: reference master's previously recorded data directory
tablet_id:: must be the string `00000000000000000000000000000000`
+
[source,bash]
Example::
+
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu local_replica cmeta print_replica_uuids --fs_wal_dir=/data/kudu/master/wal --fs_data_dirs=/data/kudu/master/data 00000000000000000000000000000000 2>/dev/null

----
+
. Using the two previously-recorded lists of UUIDs (one for all live masters and one for all
  masters), determine and record (by process of elimination) the UUID of the dead master.

==== Perform the recovery

. Format the data directory on the replacement master machine using the previously recorded
  UUID of the dead master. Use the following command sequence:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs format --fs_wal_dir=<master_wal_dir> [--fs_data_dirs=<master_data_dirs>] --uuid=<uuid>
----
+
master_data_dir:: replacement master's previously recorded data directory
uuid:: dead master's previously recorded UUID
+
[source,bash]
Example::
+
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs format --fs_wal_dir=/data/kudu/master/wal --fs_data_dirs=/data/kudu/master/data --uuid=80a82c4b8a9f4c819bab744927ad765c
----
+
. Copy the master data to the replacement master with the following command:
+
WARNING: If your Kudu cluster is secure, in addition to running as the Kudu UNIX user, you must
  authenticate as the Kudu service user prior to running this command.
+
[source,bash]

----
+
. If using CM, add the replacement Kudu master role now, but do not start it.
* Override the empty value of the `Master Address` parameter for the new role with the replacement
  master's alias.
* Add the port number (separated by a colon) if using a non-default RPC port value.

. If the cluster was set up with DNS aliases, reconfigure the DNS alias for the dead master to point
  at the replacement master.

. If the cluster was set up without DNS aliases, perform the following steps:
* Stop the remaining live masters.
* Rewrite the Raft configurations on these masters to include the replacement master. See Step 4 of
  <<perform-the-migration, Perform the Migration>> for more details.

. Start the replacement master.

. Restart the remaining masters in the new multi-master deployment. While the masters are shut down,
  there will be an availability outage, but it should last only as long as it takes for the masters
  to come back up.

Congratulations, the dead master has been replaced! To verify that all masters are working properly,
consider performing the following sanity checks:

* Using a browser, visit each master's web UI. Look at the /masters page. All of the masters should
  be listed there with one master in the LEADER role and the others in the FOLLOWER role. The
  contents of /masters on each master should be the same.

* Run a Kudu system check (ksck) on the cluster using the `kudu` command line
  tool. See <<ksck>> for more details.

=== Removing Kudu Masters from a Multi-Master Deployment

In the event that a multi-master deployment has been overallocated nodes, the following steps should
be taken to remove the unwanted masters.

WARNING: In planning the new multi-master configuration, keep in mind that the number of masters
should be odd and that three or five node master configurations are recommended.

WARNING: Dropping the number of masters below the number of masters currently needed for a Raft
majority can incur data loss. To mitigate this, ensure that the leader master is not removed during
this process.

==== Prepare for the removal

. Establish a maintenance window (one hour should be sufficient). During this time the Kudu cluster
will be unavailable.

. Identify the UUID and RPC address current leader of the multi-master deployment by visiting the
`/masters` page of any master's web UI. This master must not be removed during this process; its
removal may result in severe data loss.

. Stop all the Kudu processes in the entire cluster.

. If using CM, remove the unwanted Kudu master.

==== Perform the removal

. Rewrite the Raft configuration on the remaining masters to include only the remaining masters. See
Step 4 of <<perform-the-migration,Perform the Migration>> for more details.

. Remove the data directories and WAL directory on the unwanted masters. This is a precaution to
ensure that they cannot start up again and interfere with the new multi-master deployment.

. Modify the value of the `master_addresses` configuration parameter for the masters of the new
multi-master deployment. If migrating to a single-master deployment, the `master_addresses` flag
should be omitted entirely.

. Start all of the masters that were not removed.

. Modify the value of the `tserver_master_addrs` configuration parameter for the tablet servers to
remove any unwanted masters.

. Start all of the tablet servers.

==== Verify the migration was successful

To verify that all masters are working properly, perform the following sanity checks:

* Using a browser, visit each master's web UI. Look at the /masters page. All of the masters should
  be listed there with one master in the LEADER role and the others in the FOLLOWER role. The
  contents of /masters on each master should be the same.

* Run a Kudu system check (ksck) on the cluster using the `kudu` command line
  tool. See <<ksck>> for more details.

[[ksck]]
=== Checking Cluster Health with `ksck`

The `kudu` CLI includes a tool named `ksck` which can be used for checking
cluster health and data integrity. `ksck` will identify issues such as
under-replicated tablets, unreachable tablet servers, or tablets without a
leader.

`ksck` should be run from the command line, and requires the full list of master
addresses to be specified:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu cluster ksck master-01.example.com,master-02.example.com,master-03.example.com
----

To see a full list of the options available with `ksck`, use the `--help` flag.
If the cluster is healthy, `ksck` will print a success message, and return a
zero (success) exit status.

----
Connected to the Master
Fetched info from all 1 Tablet Servers
Table IntegrationTestBigLinkedList is HEALTHY (1 tablet(s) checked)

The metadata for 1 table(s) is HEALTHY
OK
----

If the cluster is unhealthy, for instance if a tablet server process has
stopped, `ksck` will report the issue(s) and return a non-zero exit status:

----

----

To verify data integrity, the optional `--checksum_scan` flag can be set, which
will ensure the cluster has consistent data by scanning each tablet replica and
comparing results. The `--tables` or `--tablets` flags can be used to limit the
scope of the checksum scan to specific tables or tablets, respectively. For
example, checking data integrity on the `IntegrationTestBigLinkedList` table can
be done with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu cluster ksck --checksum_scan --tables IntegrationTestBigLinkedList master-01.example.com,master-02.example.com,master-03.example.com
----

[[change_dir_config]]
=== Changing Directory Configurations

For higher read parallelism and larger volumes of storage per server, users may
want to configure servers to store data in multiple directories on different
devices. Once a server is started, users must go through the following steps
to change the directory configuration.

Users can add or remove data directories to an existing master or tablet server
via the `kudu fs update_dirs` tool. Data is striped across data directories,
and when a new data directory is added, new data will be striped across the
union of the old and new directories.

NOTE: Unless the `--force` flag is specified, Kudu will not allow for the
removal of a directory across which tablets are configured to spread data. If
`--force` is specified, all tablets configured to use that directory will fail
upon starting up and be replicated elsewhere.

NOTE: If the link:configuration.html$directory_configuration[metadata
directory] overlaps with a data directory, as was the default prior to Kudu
1.7, or if a non-default metadata directory is configured, the
`--fs_metadata_dir` configuration must be specified when running the `kudu fs
update_dirs` tool.

NOTE: Only new tablet replicas (i.e. brand new tablets' replicas and replicas
that are copied to the server for high availability) will use the new
directory. Existing tablet replicas on the server will not be rebalanced across
the new directory.

WARNING: All of the command line steps below should be executed as the Kudu
UNIX user, typically `kudu`.

. The tool can only run while the server is offline, so establish a maintenance
  window to update the server. The tool itself runs quickly, so this offline
  window should be brief, and as such, only the server to update needs to be
  offline. However, if the server is offline for too long (see the
  `follower_unavailable_considered_failed_sec` flag), the tablet replicas on it
  may be evicted from their Raft groups. To avoid this, it may be desirable to
  bring the entire cluster offline while performing the update.

. Run the tool with the desired directory configuration flags. For example, if a
  cluster was set up with `--fs_wal_dir=/wals`, `--fs_metadata_dir=/meta`, and
  `--fs_data_dirs=/data/1,/data/2,/data/3`, and `/data/3` is to be removed (e.g.
  due to a disk error), run the command:

+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu fs update_dirs --force --fs_wal_dir=/wals --fs_metadata_dir=/meta --fs_data_dirs=/data/1,/data/2
----
+

. Modify the values of the `fs_data_dirs` flags for the updated sever. If using
  CM, make sure to only update the configurations of the updated server, rather
  than of the entire Kudu service.

. Once complete, the server process can be started. When Kudu is installed using
  system packages, `service` is typically used:

+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo service kudu-tserver start
----
+


[[disk_failure_recovery]]
=== Recovering from Disk Failure
Kudu nodes can only survive failures of disks on which certain Kudu directories
are mounted. For more information about the different Kudu directory types, see
the section on link:configuration.html#directory_configuration[Kudu Directory
Configurations]. Below describes this behavior across different Apache Kudu
releases.

[[disk_failure_behavior]]
.Kudu Disk Failure Behavior
[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Node Type | Kudu Directory Type | Kudu Releases that Crash on Disk Failure
| Master | All | All
| Tablet Server | Directory containing WALs | All
| Tablet Server | Directory containing tablet metadata | All
| Tablet Server | Directory containing data blocks only | Pre-1.6.0
|===

When a disk failure occurs that does not lead to a crash, Kudu will stop using
the affected directory, shut down tablets with blocks on the affected
directories, and automatically re-replicate the affected tablets to other
tablet servers. The affected server will remain alive and print messages to the
log indicating the disk failure, for example:

----
E1205 19:06:24.163748 27115 data_dirs.cc:1011] Directory /data/8/kudu/data marked as failed
E1205 19:06:30.324795 27064 log_block_manager.cc:1822] Not using report from /data/8/kudu/data: IO error: Could not open container 0a6283cab82d4e75848f49772d2638fe: /data/8/kudu/data/0a6283cab82d4e75848f49772d2638fe.metadata: Read-only file system (error 30)

----

While in this state, the affected node will avoid using the failed disk,
leading to lower storage volume and reduced read parallelism. The administrator
should schedule a brief window to <<change_dir_config,update the node's
directory configuration>> to exclude the failed disk.

[[tablet_majority_down_recovery]]
=== Bringing a tablet that has lost a majority of replicas back online

If a tablet has permanently lost a majority of its replicas, it cannot recover
automatically and operator intervention is required. The steps below may cause
recent edits to the tablet to be lost, potentially resulting in permanent data
loss. Only attempt the procedure below if it is impossible to bring
a majority back online.

Suppose a tablet has lost a majority of its replicas. The first step in
diagnosing and fixing the problem is to examine the tablet's state using ksck:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu cluster ksck --tablets=e822cab6c0584bc0858219d1539a17e6 master-00,master-01,master-02
Connected to the Master
Fetched info from all 5 Tablet Servers
Tablet e822cab6c0584bc0858219d1539a17e6 of table 'my_table' is unavailable: 2 replica(s) not RUNNING
  638a20403e3e4ae3b55d4d07d920e6de (tserver-00:7150): RUNNING
  9a56fa85a38a4edc99c6229cba68aeaa (tserver-01:7150): bad state
    State:       FAILED
    Data state:  TABLET_DATA_READY
    Last status: <failure message>
  c311fef7708a4cf9bb11a3e4cbcaab8c (tserver-02:7150): bad state
    State:       FAILED
    Data state:  TABLET_DATA_READY
    Last status: <failure message>
----

This output shows that, for tablet `e822cab6c0584bc0858219d1539a17e6`, the two
tablet replicas on `tserver-01` and `tserver-02` failed. The remaining replica
is not the leader, so the leader replica failed as well. This means the chance
of data loss is higher since the remaining replica on `tserver-00` may have
been lagging. In general, to accept the potential data loss and restore the
tablet from the remaining replicas, divide the tablet replicas into two groups:

1. Healthy replicas: Those in `RUNNING` state as reported by ksck
2. Unhealthy replicas

For example, in the above ksck output, the replica on tablet server `tserver-00`
is healthy, while the replicas on `tserver-01` and `tserver-02` are unhealthy.
On each tablet server with a healthy replica, alter the consensus configuration
to remove unhealthy replicas. In the typical case of 1 out of 3 surviving
replicas, there will be only one healthy replica, so the consensus configuration
will be rewritten to include only the healthy replica.

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo -u kudu kudu remote_replica unsafe_change_config tserver-00:7150 <tablet-id> <tserver-00-uuid>
----

where `<tablet-id>` is `e822cab6c0584bc0858219d1539a17e6` and
`<tserver-00-uuid>` is the uuid of `tserver-00`,
`638a20403e3e4ae3b55d4d07d920e6de`.

Once the healthy replicas' consensus configurations have been forced to exclude
the unhealthy replicas, the healthy replicas will be able to elect a leader.
The tablet will become available for writes, though it will still be
under-replicated. Shortly after the tablet becomes available, the leader master
will notice that it is under-replicated, and will cause the tablet to
re-replicate until the proper replication factor is restored. The unhealthy
replicas will be tombstoned by the master, causing their remaining data to be
deleted.

[[rebuilding_kudu]]
==== Rebuilding a Kudu Filesystem Layout

In the event that critical files are lost, i.e. WALs or tablet-specific
metadata, all Kudu directories on the server must be deleted and rebuilt to
ensure correctness. Doing so will destroy the copy of the data for each tablet
replica hosted on the local server. Kudu will automatically re-replicate tablet
replicas removed in this way, provided the replication factor is at least three
and all other servers are online and healthy.

NOTE: These steps use a tablet server as an example, but the steps are the same
for Kudu master servers.

WARNING: If multiple nodes need their FS layouts rebuilt, wait until all
replicas previously hosted on each node have finished automatically
re-replicating elsewhere before continuing. Failure to do so can result in
permanent data loss.

WARNING: Before proceeding, ensure the contents of the directories are backed
up, either as a copy or in the form of other tablet replicas.

. The first step to rebuilding a server with a new directory configuration is
  emptying all of the server's existing directories. For example, if a tablet
  server is configured with `--fs_wal_dir=/data/0/kudu-tserver-wal`,
  `--fs_metadata_dir=/data/0/kudu-tserver-meta`, and
  `--fs_data_dirs=/data/1/kudu-tserver,/data/2/kudu-tserver`, the following
  commands will remove the WAL directory's and data directories' contents:

+
[source,bash]
----
# Note: this will delete all of the data from the local tablet server.
$ rm -rf /data/0/kudu-tserver-wal/* /data/0/kudu-tserver-meta/* /data/1/kudu-tserver/* /data/2/kudu-tserver/*
----
+

. If using CM, update the configurations for the rebuilt server to include only
  the desired directories. Make sure to only update the configurations of servers
  to which changes were applied, rather than of the entire Kudu service.

. After directories are deleted, the server process can be started with the new
  directory configuration. The appropriate sub-directories will be created by
  Kudu upon starting up.
